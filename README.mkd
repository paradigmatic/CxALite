Description
===========

_CxALite_ is a lightweight java library allowing users to couple
concurrent process as describe in [Complex
Automata](http://www.complex-automata.org/) (CxA) theory. It is particularly
suited for scientific computing to parallelize and couple multi-scale
and multi-science models. In its current implementation, _CxALite_
works only on shared-memory machines (multi-core and/or multi-cpu).

_CxALite_ was written to match strictly the CxA execution model described in

> P.M.A. Sloot and A.G. Hoekstra, Modeling Dynamic Systems with
  Cellular Automata", in Handbook of Dynamic System Modeling, Edior:
  Paul A. Fishwick, Series: Chapman & Hall/CRC Computer & Information
  Science Series (to be published).

Another open source implementation of CxA called
[_MUSCLE_](http://muscle.berlios.de/) (Multiscale Coupling Library and
Environment) is available also. MUSCLE is _CxALite_ big brother and has the following advantages:

  * MUSCLE allows to couple code written in Java, C, C++ and
    Fortran, where CxALite is limited to Java code.
  * MUSCLE allows to split a simulation on several machines.
  * MUSCLE contains facilities to manage physical units.

However, CxALite has a few advantages over MUSCLE:

  * CxALite has no dependencies (except the standard Java runtime).
  * CxALite has a very compact code base (less than 350 lines of code).
  * CxALite is particularly unobstrusive, allowing fast experimentation
    and prototyping.

Installation
============

Requirements
------------

There is only one requirement for the core middleware:

 * Java platform JDK (tested and developed with 1.6 but 1.5 should also work).

_CxALite_ will thus work on every machine with a valid java
installation (Linux, MacOSX, Solaris, Windows, etc.)

Additionaly, you will need to install the [ant](http://ant.apache.org/) tool if
you want to build it from source.

However optional extra code provided in _cxa.extra_ package requires extra depencies. However, all the depencies are bundled in the releases. Currently, CxALite extra needs:
  * [XOM](http://www.xom.nu/) a nice XML writer/parser, less verbose than java standard API.

Download
--------

You can grab the latest archives of _CxALite_ project at GitHub
[download page](http://github.com/paradigmatic/_CxALite_/downloads).

Alternatively, you can use the Git source manager to directly clone the current
developement repository with:

        $ git://github.com/paradigmatic/CxALite.git


Binary edition
--------------

Simply download and unpack the tarball. The jar can be directly used in classpath
and the documentation is already generated.


Source edition
--------------

The project use ant as a build tool. To compile and produce the jar:

        $ ant jar

To compile the javadoc:

        $ ant doc

The required dependencies for the extra package are included in the lib directory.


Documentation
=============

To use it, just append the needed jar to your classpath. There are currently thre jars:

  * *CxALite.jar:* the middleware base, requiring no extra depencies except a standard java environment.
  * *CxALite-examples.jar:* the compiled examples.
  * *CxALite-extra.jar:* extra class requiring dependencies found in the lib directory.

Documentation is provided as *guides* in the [wiki pages](http://wiki.github.com/paradigmatic/CxALite) and *javadoc apis* in the release bundle.

Examples
========

Have a look in 'cxa.examples' packages for examples.
